## Blog Post Week 12

### Reflect on the presentation by Christopher Snider. How does the use of open source by Tidepool compare to the user of open source by enterprise. 
I think Tidepool's use of opensource is less reliant on those open source projects than opensource use by enterprise. In Tidepool's case, they forked a project and since then have doing seperate development. It sems like they don't really rely much on other current open source tools.

### Also reflect on your group's progress.
Our group got off to a rough start I think, but by now, 2/3 of our members have submitted PR's under their belt and it seems as if the maintainers have been ramping up activity on the repo as well.  

### What are some challenges that you (as a group) need to overcome? 
Earlier, we were having a lot of issues, since we were only able to contribute to issues marked "help wanted" and there were very few open. Now, it seems as if issues are being triaged much quicker.

### What are some challenges that you (as an individual) need to overcome?
I need to be ready to jump in on issues as soon as they are marked.
