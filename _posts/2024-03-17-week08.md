## Blog Post Week 8

### What progress have you made on your group project this week?
I created an account for freeCodeCamp as well as the communication resources (discord, freeCodeCamp forum).
To familiarize myself with the project, I began to go through two lesson plans to not only improve my current skills in those areas but to potentially spot bugs found through using the site. The two curriculums I started were [Legacy Python for Everybody](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/python-for-everybody/), and [Learn esponsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/). After going through some of the lessons, I could only find very minor subjective spacing bugs, nothing I thought would be worthy of contributing to.
