## Blog Post Week 14

### Make your blog post. Reflect on the last week class discussion and your group's progress.
This week, my group and I began working on the final presentation, we started by preparing a script and answering all the questions provided on the Final Group Project wiki page. From there, we started creating a powerpoint, containing all the information as well as visual aids for the presentation. I need to finish populating the presentation with text and also get example screenshots. I think our progress was a little slow, but I am proud of what we accomplished. Making the presentation has been a good way of measuring growth and our experience with the project. It is quite clear that we started the project without a lot of knowledge about interacting with an open source community as well as working with a large codebase.
Additionally, contributed issue reports to course website.
