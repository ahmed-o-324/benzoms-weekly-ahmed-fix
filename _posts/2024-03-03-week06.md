## Blog Post Week 6

### What are your thoughts about different projects that you have looked at so far? 
They have been very interesting and helpful. At first, I felt at bit daunted at the task of contributing to an open source project, but seeing the amount of evaluations as well as the range in difficulty of contributions have helped in giving me a more realistic idea of how to go about it.

### What are you most excited about regarding working on an opens source project? 
I think I am excited and nervous to dive into production code. In the past, my academic work has been instructive but not a great idea of real world code. Additionally, in my internships, I've only built programs as a solo developer. Thus, seeing code that is maintained by many, many people and is being used in production will be a big step for me.

### What do you think will be the biggest challenges? How do you plan to overcome them?
I think the biggest challenge will be starting (although it is very possible a new biggest challenge will emerge down the road). I plan to overcome it by making sure I attend every meeting with my group, which should help me get started. At that point, the next challenge, would be to maintain active participation for the duration of this project (and hopefully longer).
