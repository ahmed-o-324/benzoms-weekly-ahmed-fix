## Blog Post Week 4
### comment about your group work on the browser extension, did you learn anything about yourself and how you are able to work with others?
Unfortunately, I was sick and missed the group activity. I did the browser extension activity on my own, and I did learn something about myself, which is indecision and uncertainty can lead me to procrastinate and make tasks seem bigger and more difficult in my head than they actually are. I just need to get started.

### comment on new things you learned (tools, features of tools that you were not familiar with, etc) or learned about yourself (skills you realized you have, team work preferences and style, etc.)
I am already familiar with some web development stuff and I have a decent understanding of JavaScript, however, I have never made an extension for a browser before. In the browser activity, I learned how to do so and the base concept is not as difficult/complicated as I thought it was.

### comment on other teams presentations and their projects, did you have any favorites?
I was unfortunately unable to attend the team presentations.
