### What is your opinion on having a code of conduct in open-source projects?
I think it is necessary to have a code of ocnduct in open-source projects since, for me, open-source projects inherently mean collaboration and freedom, and without a code of conduct it is very likely that we will see inappropriate contributions to the project. 

### Why do you think having a code of conduct is important?
I think it is important to have a code of conduct since it keeps all collaborators on the same page in regards to responsibilities, behavior and more

### How does a code of conduct benefit both users and contributors in open-source projects?
A code of conduct can benefit users and contributors in ways such as letting both parties what to expect from the project in terms of
- contributions
- use
- responsibilities
- behavior

### Would you be willing to contribute to a project that lacks a code of conduct? Why or why not?
I, personally, would not contribute to a project lacking a code of conduct since if that was the case it seems unprofessional and unorganized

### How do you think enforcement of a code of conduct can be achieved in open-source projects, particularly in large-scale ones?
I think enforcement of a code of conduct in open-source projects can be achieved by havgin a trusted moderating team that approves larger-scale contributions from contributors, although could be more easier said than done.
