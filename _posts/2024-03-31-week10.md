## Blog Post Week 10

### What progress have you made on your group project this week?

Back from spring break! Over break, I worked on a PR for an open issue and although it was blocked, it was overall a helpful learning experience. I was able to get familiar with the codebase, the challenge editor, challenge structure, PR etiquette, and more. 
The [PR](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/54177) itself referenced issue [#5454](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/53542).
