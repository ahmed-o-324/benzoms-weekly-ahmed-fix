## Blog Post Week 3

### Comment on the git exercises we did in class. 
The git/fetch activity was very illuminating. Previously, I had used git for almost every CS class I've taken but I'd rarely go beyond pushing and pulling. Using forks was pretty new to me and so was the collaborative work.

### Comment on the work with your team and progress you have made towards your first browser extension (what are some problems the group is facing, what good things happened, how do you fit into the collaboration, what are your biggest contributions)
Unfortunately, I was absent for the group activity so I had to go through the material on my own.
