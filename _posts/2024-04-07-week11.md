## Blog Post Week 11

### Make your blog post. Reflect on the videos you watched about different industries' use of open source technologies, the reasons behind use of open source and the relationship between industry and open source projects. Also reflect on your group's progress on the project. Are there surprises in the project you selected. What has been the biggest challenge so far.
I think the biggest challenges so far has been locating items that need help, it seems like the maintainers in charge of triaging are releasing issues at a slower rate than we would like. Luckily, in the past week, it seems as if the maintainers are triaging sooner and more commonly, giving us a greater amount of issues we can try to help with. This obstacle was not much of a surprise though, since we had been told that other groups in this class years before had had similar issues when working with freeCodeCamp.
